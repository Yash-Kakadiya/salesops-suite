    "# 09: Long-Term Memory & Contextual Learning 🧠\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Cognitive Layer** of the SalesOps Agent Suite (Day 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, our agents were \"amnesic\"—they processed every anomaly as if it were the first one they had ever seen. In this notebook, we introduce the **Memory Bank**, a vector-based semantic storage system that allows the agent to \"remember\" past incidents and \"learn\" from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Goals\n",
    "1.  **Initialize Memory Bank:** Spin up the local vector store with PII protection enabled.\n",
    "2.  **Simulate Learning:** \"Teach\" the agent by feeding it historical resolutions (e.g., \"We fixed the West Region spike by updating the pricing model\").\n",
    "3.  **Demonstrate RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Feed a *new* anomaly to the Explainer Agent and verify that it automatically retrieves and references the relevant history to provide a smarter answer.\n",
    "4.  **Verify Safety:** Prove that sensitive data (emails/phones) is automatically redacted before being stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Components Used\n",
    "* `agents.memory_agent.MemoryAgent`: The bridge between business logic and the vector store.\n",
    "* `memory.memory_bank.MemoryBank`: The core storage engine handling Embeddings, TTL, and Atomicity.\n",
    "* `agents.anomaly_llm_agent.AnomalyExplainerAgent`: The AI analyst now upgraded with RAG capabilities."
